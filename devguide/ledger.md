## Entry 0 — 2026-03-11 — Initial Scaffold (as RTSGame)

**Phase:** 1 (Foundation)
**Status:** Complete (pre-pivot)

**What was built:**
- Full project scaffold: package.json, .gitignore, .env.example, server config
- WebSocket game server with room management (create, join, leave, list, ready, launch)
- Game engine with tick loop, unit movement, starting units/buildings
- Static file server with IsometricJS asset fallback
- Client: name entry, lobby UI, room view, chat, game view with isometric rendering
- Isometric projection adapted from IsometricJS
- Canvas 2D game renderer with placeholder graphics
- Unit selection, right-click movement commands
- Minimap, Resource HUD, camera pan and zoom

**Files created:**
- `server/config.js`, `server/room-manager.js`, `server/game-engine.js`, `server/server.js`
- `src/dev-client-server.js`
- `src/public/index.html`, `src/public/css/style.css`
- `src/public/js/projection.js`, `src/public/js/lobby.js`, `src/public/js/app.js`
- `src/tests/room-manager.test.js`, `src/tests/game-engine.test.js`, `src/tests/server-integration.test.js`

**Tests:** 18 unit + integration tests covering room lifecycle, game engine, and server protocol

## Entry 1 — 2026-03-11 — Expanded Unit Definitions & Damage Calc (as RTSGame)

**Phase:** 3 (Units & Combat)
**Status:** Complete (pre-pivot)

**What was built:**
- Extracted unit definitions into UNIT_DEFS with combat stats
- Added calcDamage function with counter system
- 12 new tests

**Files changed:**
- `server/game-engine.js`, `src/tests/game-engine.test.js`

**Tests:** 35 total (12 new)

## Entry 2 — 2026-03-11 — Project Pivot: RTS → Space Colony 4X

**Phase:** N/A (retool)
**Status:** Complete

**What changed:**
- Pivoted from medieval RTS to space colony 4X game (Stellaris-inspired)
- Replaced all project documentation, design roadmap, and automation skills
- Moving from Canvas 2D sprites to Three.js 3D rendering
- New core loop: Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate
- New resource system: Energy, Minerals, Food, Alloys, Research, Influence
- Kept: WebSocket multiplayer infrastructure, room/lobby system, tick-based game loop

**Key decisions:**
- Three.js for rendering — isometric OrthographicCamera for colony view, PerspectiveCamera for galaxy map
- No sprites — all 3D geometry and materials
- Colony management as primary gameplay, fleet/galaxy as secondary layer
- Simultaneous real-time multiplayer (like Stellaris, not turn-based)

**Next:** Phase 1 — Foundation Pivot (Three.js integration, colony terrain, new game engine)

---

## Entry 3 — 2026-03-11 — Colony 4X Engine & Resource System

**Phase:** 1 (Foundation Pivot)
**Status:** Complete

**What was built:**
- Complete rewrite of game-engine.js from RTS to colony 4X: removed unit movement/combat, UNIT_DEFS, calcDamage
- Colony state system: districts[], buildQueue[], pops, planet properties (size, type, habitability)
- 6 district types with production/consumption: Housing, Generator, Mining, Agriculture, Industrial, Research
- Per-player resource tracking: energy, minerals, food, alloys, research (3 types), influence
- Monthly economic cycle (every 100 ticks): resource production, consumption, pop food costs
- Construction system: build queue (max 3), build time with 50% discount for first 3 districts
- Demolish command for removing built districts
- Population system: food deficit causes pop death, pops cannot go below 1
- Unemployed pops produce research (1 each type per unemployed pop per month)
- Updated server.js protocol: buildDistrict and demolish commands replace old gameCommand/moveUnits
- Server validates ownership, resources, slots, queue limits on every command
- Planet type definitions with habitability values (9 types)

**Files changed:**
- `server/game-engine.js` — complete rewrite (colony 4X engine)
- `server/server.js` — updated protocol handlers, log message
- `src/tests/game-engine.test.js` — complete rewrite (38 tests)
- `src/tests/server-integration.test.js` — updated for colony protocol (5 tests including 2 new)
- `devguide/design.md` — marked 4 tasks complete
- `devguide/ledger.md` — this entry

**Tests:** 50 total (38 game-engine + 12 room-manager + 5 integration). All passing.

**Key decisions:**
- Built economy loop before Three.js rendering (game designer recommendation: playable mechanics > pretty graphics)
- Production is per-month (100 ticks = 10 seconds), not per-tick, for balanced pacing
- handleCommand returns result objects {ok/error} so server.js can send errors to client
- Starting colonies get 3 pre-built districts so resources flow immediately without player action

**Next:** Add Three.js dependency and basic scene setup (Phase 1 rendering tasks), or basic resource HUD to make the economy visible

## Entry 4 — 2026-03-11 — Balance Fix: Energy Economy

**Phase:** 1 (Foundation Pivot)
**Status:** Complete

**What was built:**
- Rebalanced all energy-related district values to make alloys and research obtainable
- Generator output increased from 4 to 6 energy/month
- Industrial energy consumption reduced from 50 to 3 energy/month, energy build cost removed
- Research energy consumption reduced from 100 to 4 energy/month, energy build cost reduced from 100 to 20
- Housing now consumes 1 energy/month (was 0)
- Fixed _calcProduction to apply consumption from jobless districts (housing)

**Files changed:**
- `server/game-engine.js` — DISTRICT_DEFS values, _calcProduction jobless district handling
- `src/tests/game-engine.test.js` — updated 2 existing tests, added 8 new energy balance tests
- `devguide/design.md` — marked task complete
- `devguide/ledger.md` — this entry

**Tests:** 63 total (46 game-engine + 12 room-manager + 5 integration). All passing.

**Key decisions:**
- One generator (6 energy) can power two industrial districts (3 energy each) — achievable ratio
- Housing energy cost (1/month) adds meaningful energy pressure as colonies grow without being punishing
- Removed industrial energy build cost entirely (was 50) rather than reducing — minerals-only cost keeps it accessible
- Added production calc fix for jobless districts so housing consumption actually applies

**Next:** Fix starting food deficit (2 Agriculture districts), then pop growth pacing

## Entry 5 — 2026-03-11 — Balance Fix: Starting Food Deficit & Housing

**Phase:** 1 (Foundation Pivot)
**Status:** Complete

**What was built:**
- Changed starting pre-built districts from (1 Generator, 1 Mining, 1 Agriculture) to (1 Generator, 1 Mining, 2 Agriculture) so food production (12) exceeds consumption (10 pops × 1 = 10), giving a net +2 food/month surplus
- Increased base capital housing from 2 to 10 so starting 10 pops don't exceed housing on turn 1
- Updated all existing tests to match new starting state (4 districts, 10 housing, adjusted food/research values)
- Added 4 new balance validation tests

**Files changed:**
- `server/game-engine.js` — _initStartingColonies (added 2nd agriculture), _calcHousing (base 2→10)
- `src/tests/game-engine.test.js` — updated 8 existing tests, added 4 new food/housing balance tests
- `devguide/design.md` — marked task complete
- `devguide/ledger.md` — this entry

**Tests:** 68 total (50 game-engine + 12 room-manager + 5 integration + 1 server-integration). All passing.

**Key decisions:**
- 2 Agriculture districts (12 food) vs 10 pops (10 food) gives a slim +2/month surplus — enough to survive but players still need to build more agriculture as they grow pops
- Base housing of 10 matches starting pops exactly — players need housing districts to grow beyond 10 pops, creating a meaningful early decision
- Pop death test needed adjustment: food set to -10 (not -1) because +2/month net surplus now recovers from small deficits

**Next:** Pop growth pacing (colony.growthProgress, +1 pop based on food surplus thresholds)

---

## Entry 6 — 2026-03-11 — Pop Growth System

**Phase:** 1 (Foundation Pivot)
**Status:** Complete

**What was built:**
- Pop growth system: colonies grow +1 pop over time when food surplus > 0
- Growth progress counter (`colony.growthProgress`) increments every tick
- Three growth speed tiers based on food surplus: base (400 ticks), fast (300 ticks when surplus > 5), fastest (200 ticks when surplus > 10)
- Housing cap enforcement — pops cannot grow beyond housing capacity
- Starvation resets growth progress to 0
- Growth constants exported for test use (GROWTH_BASE_TICKS, GROWTH_FAST_TICKS, GROWTH_FASTEST_TICKS)
- Refactored old `_processPopGrowth` into `_processPopStarvation` (monthly) and `_processPopGrowth` (per-tick)

**Files changed:**
- `server/game-engine.js` — growth constants, growthProgress field, _processPopGrowth (per-tick), _processPopStarvation (monthly), state serialization
- `src/tests/game-engine.test.js` — 8 new pop growth tests
- `devguide/design.md` — marked task complete
- `devguide/ledger.md` — this entry

**Tests:** 77 total (58 game-engine + 12 room-manager + 6 integration + 1 server-integration). All passing.

**Key decisions:**
- Growth checks production rate (food surplus = production - consumption), not resource stockpile — a colony with good farms grows even if the empire's food reserves are low
- Growth progress increments every tick (not monthly) for smooth progression and responsive gameplay
- Housing cap check before incrementing prevents wasted progress accumulation
- Starvation resets growth progress to create meaningful penalty for food deficits

**Next:** Early mineral pacing (Mining output 4→6, starting minerals 200→300, Mining cost 150→100)
